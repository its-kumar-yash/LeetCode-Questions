Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.



**Using Binary Search**
* Time Complexity - O( N* LogN)
```
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end(), greater<>());
        int n = citations.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if( i >= citations[i]){
                return i;
            }
        }
         
        return n;
    }
};
```
