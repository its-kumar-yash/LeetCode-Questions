You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int s = 0;
        int e = n - 1;
        int mid;
        
        while(s <= e){
            mid = s + (e - s)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(nums[mid] < target){
                s = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                e = mid - 1;
            }
            
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
