You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.



class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        s += t;
        int c = 0, n = s.length();
        
        for(int i = 0; i< n; i++){
            c ^= s[i]; 
        }
        
        return c;
    }
};
