Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while( n != 0){
            if(n&1){ //checking last bit
                cnt++;
            }
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
