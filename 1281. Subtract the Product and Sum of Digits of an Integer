Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

class Solution {
public:
    int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;
        int rem;
        
        while( n != 0){
            rem = n % 10;
            sum += rem;
            product *= rem;
            n /= 10;
        }
        
        return (product - sum);
    }
};
