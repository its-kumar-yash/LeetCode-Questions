Given two numbers, hour and minutes, return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.


class Solution {
public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        //e.g. 3:30
        double ans;
        
        ans = abs(minutes*6 - (hour*30 + minutes*0.5));
        //degree Moved by minutes hand :- minutes*6     e.g 30*6 = 180
        //degree Moved by start hand :- hour*30 + minutes*0.5   e.g 3*30 + 30*0.5 = 105 
        // ans = 180 - 105 = 75
        
        if ( ans > 180){
            return 360 - ans;
        }
        else{
            return ans;
        }
        
    }
};
