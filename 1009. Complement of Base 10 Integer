The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement.


class Solution {
public:
    int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        //creating a copy of n, to prevent changes in n
        int m = n;
        //initializing mask
        int mask = 0;
        
        //Edge Case
        if(n==0){
            return 1;
        }
        if (n==1){
            return 0;
        }
        
        while(m!=0){
            mask = (mask << 1) | 1;
            m = m>>1;
        }
        
        int ans = (~n) & mask;
        return ans;
    }
};
