Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.


int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        int cnt = 0, i =0, j =0;
        int m = g.size(), n = s.size();
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        
        
        while(i < m && j < n){
            if(s[j] >= g[i]){
                cnt++;
                i++;
                
            }
            
            j++;
            
        }
        
        return cnt;
}
